In this project, I ingested raw data;
I understood how to apply data engineering processes;
Produced a structured analysis based on the read data;
I understood why perform the parallelization of transformation processes on raw data;
I applied the protected business rules on drops in the ingested data;
I made a union of different bases so that they have correlations that can be extracted; Finally,
persisted the results of the transformations for processes that used the treated data.
